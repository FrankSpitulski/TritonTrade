TritonTrade Android Application 
README:

Introduction:
TritonTrade is an application that was built to streamline and focus the UCSD free market experience. Rather than just seeing every post, users can follow categories allowing them to only see posts of what they are interested in. We fulfill all the functions of a traditional marketplace, allowing users to create “buy” and “sell” posts, see post history, and view user and other profiles.

TritonTrade is no means complete and is an ongoing goal for both myself and the rest of the Triton Merchant Network Technologies team. We hope you enjoy the experience. 

Sincerely, TMNT

Known Issues:
Images may not be viewable in the create post screen depending on your internet connection speed. If the activity is reloaded before the upload completes, a blank image will be shown instead.
Marking posts as sold from the account page will not be reflected in your post history or active listings until the account page is reloaded.
If the application is inactive for long periods of time, the system garbage collector may cull necessary state variables. When the app attempts to restart on the same screen, those variables will be gone, causing crashes. Please refer to the instructions above for reloading on a crash.
